Political analysis from Twitter data


“Political polarization and inequality have run together for the last 40 years, as the country has grown more unequal, the parties have grown further apart…
As polarization increases, so does political gridlock and it becomes harder for the political system to respond to growing inequality.”
-Lee Drutman

We have watched as the presidency became the world’s most popular reality TV show. 
After reading the quote mentioned above, I realized that the problem ran deep -Trump was a product of the current state of affairs, not the cause. 
With another election around the corner, I decided to see if I could illuminate patterns and differences between Republican and Democratic ways of expression to try
and discover a better explanation. The question that I posed was "Could we train a model to accurately predict political lean?" 

This video is where I detail the process and my findings about political idiolects from Twitter data, the spread of malign narratives across social media networks
and the potential bot detection application of my project:
